I am a Robotics graduate student from the School of Computer Science - at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh). I specialize in Computer Vision/ Machine Learning, focusing on Autonomous vehicles. I work at Motional (A self-driving car company) as a Senior Engineer (Autonomy). 
In my current role, I am responsible for developing novel state-of-the-art ML-based Computer Vision algorithms to make better and faster online perception systems. I, along with my team, ensure that the ML networks I develop are efficient enough to be deployed on our production cars as well. 
Previously in 2019, I worked at Aptiv as a perception intern. There, I developed a novel deep-learning-based auto-annotation tool for HD Maps. We patented the technology as well. 
Also, I have worked as a researcher for an autonomous truck collision avoidance project at Carnegie Mellon, sponsored by Daimler Trucks North America. I was responsible for the Perception, Tracking, and Sensor Fusion pipeline.
Before coming to CMU, I worked at the RnD division of Maruti Suzuki.

I have a number of patents and published research papers under my name, I also believe in giving back to the Machine Learning research community with research paper reviews and keynote tutorial sessions.

When I am not doing Machine Learning I read content on human psychology, financial investments, the Future of humanity, and macroeconomics; do Work-outs of all kinds; Cook healthy & tasty meals.
